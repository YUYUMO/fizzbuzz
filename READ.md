Recently I tackled the classic FizzBuzz problem.

Task:

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

This involved implementing a for loop, utilizing the remainder operator, and crafting complex conditional logic to print "Fizz," "Buzz," or "FizzBuzz" based on divisibility rules. It was a fantastic way to sharpen my problem-solving skills.
